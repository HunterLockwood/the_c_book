Inspired by a late night in the old house, up deep in the woods, in a place where there's not enough internet to go around, but more than enough old hardware that can run C.

# Workflow So Far

1. Read a little.
2. Find a program that sounds interesting.
3. Write the program.
4. Compile it using `clang`
5. Run it using `./{output-name}`
